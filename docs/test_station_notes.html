<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The 'nhaystack' module for Niagara 4 comes ready with an extensive test suite.<br />The test suite configuration allows a developer to run automated tests against more than 1 running Niagara station and exercise the Haystack REST API in different scenarios. The test suite is constantly evolving and more tests and scenarios are always being added.</p>
<p>By configuring and running a number of Niagara stations a developer is able to simulate a sufficient range of test scenarios.</p>
<p>The following notes describe how to use the test harness for testing against a live Niagara Station.</p>
<p>This document also describes how to run a small number of other unit tests using the Niagara TestNG test harness.</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>The test stations for the nhaystack module are distributed as Niagara Station templates. This means that a developer who wishes to run the 'nhaystack' test suite must first create new stations on their local system using the distributed station templates.</p>
<h2 id="setup-and-execution">Setup and execution</h2>
<p>Step 1 in running the test suite is to clone/download the 'nhaystack' repository and build the relevant Niagara modules ensuring that both the runtime and workbench profile modules have been copied into the <niagara_home>folder.</p>
<p>Step 2 is to copy the station template files included with the 'nhaystack' repository to the <niagara_user_home>folder so they can be found by the Niagara Workbench.</p>
<p>Step 3 is to create a new instance of each of the test stations using the templates.</p>
<p>Documentation for creating new Niagara stations from a template is available with your Niagara 4 distribution. The most efficient way to run the 'nhaystack' test harness would be to create each of the stations mentioned below. Once a copy of each station has been created and the administrator credentials have been configured it will be possible to run the test suite.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that every time the stations are created, when creating via a template, new admnistrator credentials must be configured it is necessary to change the credentials in the test suite. To do this edit the SimpleClientTest.java and the SupervisorClientTest.java, searching for any references to the username and password for the respective stations and replacing the credentials in the source code with the configured when creating the test stations from the templates.</p>
<p>Once this is done it will be possible to run the test harness using the 'gradlew' command.</p>
<p>
<code>gradlew test</code>
</p>
<p>This will build and run the test suite against the running test stations. If you receive errors check that the test stations have started properly and there are no port conflicts. It is recommended that the test stations are started using the Niagara Workbench, in this way they will be started under the Platform Daemon and have full crypto and security functionality operational, thus enabling a more realistic test scenario.</p>

<p>This station simulates a scenario where there is only a single Jace talking to a system. In this case we imagine that a &quot;Haystack Client&quot; is querying the Jace for points and history data. So this station has a setup that mimics many different use cases for a Jace using 'nhaystack'.</p>

<h2 id="nhaystack_sup">nhaystack_sup</h2>
<p>This is an example of a larger setup of a Niagara system. In this case there is 2 Jaces setup and a Web Supervisor. THe Web Supervisor station is already configured with the subordinate Jaces in the Niagara Network. The subordinate JACEs do not have any 'Haystack' tagging, they are just normal Niagara stations simulating the function of a JACE.</p>

<h2 id="niagara-test-harness">Niagara Test Harness</h2>
<p>There is currently a small number of unit tests that can be run using the Niagara Test Harness. The details of the test harness can be found in the developer documentation in the Niagara installation, however it is quite simple to run the test harness.</p>
<p>First you need to build the Niagara Test Module: <br></p>
<p>
<code>gradlew moduleTestJar</code>
</p>
<p>then assuming you have already built the main nhaystack modules you can run the following from the command line in a Niagara shell.</p>
<p>
<code>test nhaystack</code>
</p>
<p>This will run the automated tests in the Niagara environment. Test results are viewable in the form of a HTML report which can be found under the Niagara User Home directory.</p>
